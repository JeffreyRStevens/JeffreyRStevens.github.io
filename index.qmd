I am a Susan J. Rosowski Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where I direct the <a target='_blank' href='https://dogcog.unl.edu'>Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab</a>. I am also a Data Science Mentor at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.rstudio.com/academy'>RStudio Academy</a>.

My research program uses data science to understand decision making in humans and other animals. My research integrates perspectives from biology, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and economics. I employ open science practices to ensure that my work is transparent, accessible, and reproducible.
    
I train the next generation of data scientists. As a professor, I have trained hundreds of undergraduates, graduate students, and even faculty in how to think about, analyze, visualize, and report their data. As a data science mentor at RStudio, I do the same for corporate employees
