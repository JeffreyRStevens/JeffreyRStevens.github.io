CCHIL is elated to be part of a very exciting initiative called the [ManyDogs Project](http://manydogs.org) that brings together dog behavior and cognition labs worldwide together to study canine science. We have a [paper](https://doi.org/10.3819/CCBR.2023.180004) published in _Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews_ that introduces this initiative, but here we give a quick summary.

## What is the ManyDogs Project?

ManyDogs is a collaboration between dog behavior and cognition labs worldwide interested in running the same studies across sites.

The project kicked off at a [Comparative Cognition Society Conference](), where a number of canine researchers got together to talk about joining forces to collect data together. CCHIL was invited to join in March 2020 (yes, that March 2020)---we readily agreed and haven't looked back since. While starting off with just a handful of labs, we now boast more than 25 participating sites and are intent to keep growing!
