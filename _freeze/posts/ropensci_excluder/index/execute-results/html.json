First, we'll learn how to set up your Qualtrics survey to collect the relevant information. Then we'll learn how to mark, check, and exclude observations based on the metadata. Finally, we'll clean up our data sets by deidentifying them.\n\n\n## Before collecting your data\n\nAs a reminder, excluder focuses on _metadata_ about an entry rather than the actual responses. \nIf you have particular questions from your specific survey that you want to use to exclude data (for example, questions specifically designed to check the attentiveness of respondents), you should use regular subset/filter functions from [base R](https://rdrr.io/r/base/subset.html) or [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html). \nHere, we're focusing on metadata collected about your survey respondents.\n\nBut to use this metadata, you must first collect it! Though the excluder package can work with metadata from other survey systems (e.g., SurveyMonkey), we'll focus on data coming from Qualtrics surveys. There are two options in Qualtrics that allow you to collect the metadata that excluder can work with.\n\n### Anonymous vs. non-anonymous data\nFirst, Qualtrics can collect either anonymous or non-anonymous data. \nNon-anonymous data include IP address, geolocation, and contact information provided by you (if you have Qualtrics email your respondents). \nTo collect non-anonymous data, you must toggle the switch _Off_ under _Survey_ > _Options_ > _Security_ > [_Anonymize responses_](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/survey-protection/#AnonymizingResponses). \nIf you collect non-anonymous data, just make sure that respondents know that you're collecting their IP address and location[^4]. \n\n![](qualtrics_anonymize.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of Qualtrics Survey > Options > Security tab.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600\"}\n\nSource: Jeffrey Stevens\n\n### Computer metadata\n\nIn addition to IP address and location, Qualtrics can also collect information about the computer environment that respondents use to take your survey, such as operating system, browser type and version, and screen resolution.\nTo collect the [computer metadata](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/meta-info-question/), you must create a question in your survey in a block that already has another question. \nClick _Add a new question_ and select the _Meta info_ question type.\n\n![](qualtrics_metadata.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of adding a Meta info question to a Qualtrics survey.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600\"}\n\nSource: Jeffrey Stevens\n\n## Removing problematic data\n\nNow that we've collected the proper metadata, we can use it to deal with potentially problematic data.\n\n### Metadata\n\nHere are seven types of metadata that excluder works with, along with their tags that are used in excluder functions.\n\n* **Qualtrics preview status** (`preview`): \nQualtrics records data when you [preview your survey](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/preview-survey/) before deploying it. \nYou probably always want to remove preview data.\n* **Survey progress** (`progress`): \nQualtrics tracks how much of the survey the respondent completes. \nexcluder can detect surveys which are incomplete.\n* **Survey completion time** (`duration`): \nQualtrics records the number of seconds that the respondent works on the survey. \nexcluder can detect completion times that are too fast or that take too long.\n* **IP address country** (`ip`)<sup>*</sup>: \nIf IP addresses are collected, they can determine the country of origin for the respondent. \nexcluder can detect IP addresses outside of a specified country. \nNote, however, that VPNs can use IP addresses outside of the country of origin, so you must weigh the possibility of false alarms in detecting IP addresses from other countries.\n* **Geolocation in US** (`location`)<sup>*</sup>: \nQualtrics determines geolocation (latitude and longitude) through GPS or IP addresses. \nexcluder can detect locations within the United States but cannot detect this for other countries at the moment.\n* **Duplicate IP address** (`duplicates`)<sup>*</sup>: \nAutomated bots may spam your survey from the same IP address. \nexcluder detects if the same IP address shows up repeatedly in your data. \nNote, however, that duplicate IP addresses may be legitimately different respondents using the same computer or recycled dynamic IP address in the same household, dormitory, or business. \nSo you must weigh the costs of losing good data against the benefits of removing bad data.\n* **Screen resolution** (`resolution`)<sup>**</sup>: \nSometimes, you may request that respondents use a particular kind of device for your survey, such as a desktop computer rather than a phone or tablet. \nexcluder can assess screen resolution to detect respondents who may be using the wrong type of device.\n\n<sup>*</sup> You must have enabled [non-anonymized data](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/survey-protection/#AnonymizingResponses) in Qualtrics to collect these metadata.\n\n<sup>**</sup> You must have included the [computer metadata question](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/meta-info-question/) in Qualtrics to collect these metadata.\n\n### Marking rows\n\nOK, now that we know what kind of metadata we can work with, what do we do with them? \nThe excluder package can do three actions on the metadata: mark, check, or exclude. \nThe mark functions are the backbone of the package.\nMark functions make new columns with the metadata criteria output appended to the existing data frame. \nSo you pass a data frame to the mark functions to see which rows meet the metadata criteria.\nMark function names simple prepend `mark_` to the metadata tag. So, for example, the function that marks preview metadata (`preview`) is `mark_preview()`. \n\nBefore we start marking, let's look at an example data set that we can work with. The `qualtrics_text` data set includes both non-anonymous and computer metadata. We'll just look at the first six rows by piping to `head()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(excluder)\nqualtrics_text %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            StartDate             EndDate         Status    IPAddress Progress\n1 2020-12-11 12:06:52 2020-12-11 12:10:30 Survey Preview         <NA>      100\n2 2020-12-11 12:06:43 2020-12-11 12:11:27 Survey Preview         <NA>      100\n3 2020-12-11 12:17:22 2020-12-11 12:21:41     IP Address   73.23.43.0      100\n4 2020-12-11 12:17:41 2020-12-11 12:22:07     IP Address 16.140.105.0      100\n5 2020-12-11 12:19:45 2020-12-11 12:23:16     IP Address 107.57.244.0      100\n6 2020-12-11 12:37:51 2020-12-11 12:43:09     IP Address 15.232.167.0      100\n  Duration (in seconds) Finished        RecordedDate        ResponseId\n1                   465     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:10:30 R_xLWiuPaNuURSFXY\n2                   545     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:11:27 R_Q5lqYw6emJQZx2o\n3                   651     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:21:42 R_fbYBeNscosfzN9L\n4                   409     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:22:07 R_yyG1HGXOMNPfWDn\n5                   140     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:23:16 R_9dnzH1VI9mf8gle\n6                   213     TRUE 2020-12-11 12:43:09 R_1BoPF5igdMw536H\n  LocationLatitude LocationLongitude UserLanguage Browser      Version\n1         29.73694         -94.97599           EN  Chrome 88.0.4324.41\n2         39.74107        -121.82490           EN  Chrome 88.0.4324.50\n3         34.03852        -118.25739           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n4         44.96581         -93.07187           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n5         27.98064         -82.78531           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n6         29.76499         -95.36156           EN  Chrome 87.0.4280.88\n  Operating System Resolution\n1  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n2        Macintosh  1680x1050\n3  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n4  Windows NT 10.0   1536x864\n5  Windows NT 10.0   1536x864\n6  Windows NT 10.0   1366x768\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy looking at the `Status` column, we can already see that the first two rows are previews.

The [qualtRics](https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/) package is a huge help in automating the import of data into R. \nAs we learned in [Part 1](/blog/2022/08/02/working-with-qualtrics-data-importing/), after connecting to the Qualtrics API, we can quickly (and powerfully) import our Qualtrics data with the [`fetch_survey()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/qualtRics/reference/fetch_survey.html) function.\nOnce those data are imported, we can use the [excluder](https://docs.ropensci.org/excluder/) package to deal with potentially problematic online survey data based on respondent metadata, using the mark, check, and exclude functions. \nThen we can deidentify our data set before continuing to work with it or passing it on to others.\nCombined, these two packages can improve your data workflow by automating import and early cleaning processes, leaving the fun part of data processing up to you!\n\n![](happy_data.jpg){fig-alt=\"A person sitting on a black couch with a laptop is looking left and smiling.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600\"}\n\nSource: Brooke Cagle on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/LCcFI_26diA).\n\nIf you have ideas for improvements to the excluder package or if you find bugs, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/excluder/issues) on the [excluder GitHub repo](https://github.com/ropensci/excluder/).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nIn developing the excluder package, I thank [Francine Goh](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7364-4398) and Billy\nLim for comments on an early version of the package, as well as the\ninsightful feedback during [peer review](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/455) from rOpenSci editor [Mauro Lepore](/author/mauro-lepore/) and reviewers [Joseph O’Brien](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9851-5077) and [Julia\nSilge](/author/julia-silge/).
